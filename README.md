# UdpToTcp
**A little preview** -
As you might know, udp is a straight foword protocal who just "sends and hopes for the best".
On the other hand, Tcp is a more sofisticated protocol that make sure all data has been received properly(in the currect order, etc...).

****Description** -**
In this project, my parther Naor Alkobi and I made a client-sever protocol that uses an udp socket that implements tcp protocol in the aplication layer, resulting a "Udp-To-Tcp" socket.
